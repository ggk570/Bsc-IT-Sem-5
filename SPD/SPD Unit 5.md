#### <span style="color:blue;">1. Explain five basic stages of Team Development. Also state the different types of people needed to form a balanced team.</span>
The development of a team typically follows five stages, as identified by psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965. These stages are commonly referred to as **Tuckman’s Stages of Group Development**. They are:
1. **Forming**:    
    - This is the initial stage when the team is first created. Team members are polite, reserved, and getting to know each other. There’s often uncertainty about roles, goals, and the work process. Members typically rely on the leader for direction and clarity.
    - **Focus**: Establishing relationships, understanding the goals, and defining roles.
2. **Storming**:
    - In this stage, team members begin to express differing opinions, ideas, and approaches. Conflict and disagreements may arise as people start to assert their personalities and work styles. This stage can be challenging, but it is necessary for team development because it helps clarify differences and establish a stronger foundation for collaboration.
    - **Focus**: Resolving conflicts, clarifying goals, and aligning on the team’s purpose.
3. **Norming**:
    - As conflicts are resolved, team members begin to establish norms and routines. There is a greater sense of trust and cooperation, and roles become more clearly defined. Communication improves, and the team works more cohesively toward shared goals.
    - **Focus**: Building trust, solidifying roles, and developing team norms.
4. **Performing**:
    - At this stage, the team is working at a high level of efficiency. Members are now well-organized, collaborate effectively, and focus on achieving team goals. There is a sense of autonomy, with little need for oversight from the leader, as the team is functioning independently and effectively.
    - **Focus**: Maximizing productivity, collaboration, and goal achievement.
5. **Adjourning** (sometimes called "Mourning"):
    - This stage occurs when the team has completed its objectives and is disbanding. It can involve a sense of closure and reflection, with team members acknowledging their accomplishments and, in some cases, experiencing emotions related to the end of the team’s journey.
    - **Focus**: Reflection, recognition, and closure.
**Types of people needed to form a balance team:**
A well-rounded team requires different types of people to ensure that all necessary skills, perspectives, and roles are covered.
1. **The Leader:** The leader provides direction, ensures alignment with goals, and manages team dynamics. They often make decisions, mediate conflicts, and keep the team focused on achieving objectives.
2. **The Planner:** Planners are methodical and detail-oriented. They excel at setting timelines, creating project plans, and keeping everyone on track with tasks and deadlines.
3. **The Innovator:** The innovator is the person who brings fresh ideas, creativity, and new perspectives to the table. They are crucial for brainstorming, suggesting innovative solutions, and thinking outside the box.
4. **The Implementer:** The implementer is practical and action-oriented. They focus on executing plans and ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently. They are great at turning ideas into reality.
5. **The Communicator:** Communicators are the people who help the team build strong relationships and maintain open lines of communication. They ensure that team members feel heard, valued, and engaged, which helps improve morale and cohesion.
6. **The Specialist:** The specialist provides deep expertise in a specific area relevant to the team’s goals. Whether technical, subject-specific, or industry-related, their specialized knowledge is essential for solving complex problems.

#### <span style="color:blue;">2. Student fails in the project, if the projects are not closed properly. Justify this statement</span>
1. The statement, _"A student fails in the project if the projects are not closed properly,"_ can be justified by highlighting the importance of project closure in ensuring successful outcomes.
2. Here's how improper or incomplete project closure can lead to failure:
	1. **Unfinished Tasks**: Without proper closure, key tasks or deliverables might be incomplete, leading to an incomplete or subpar project submission.
	2. **No Evaluation**: Proper closure involves assessing the project’s success. Without evaluation, the student misses the opportunity to learn from mistakes, affecting their growth and performance.
	3. **Missed Documentation**: Closing the project involves submitting final reports, reflections, or presentations. If this is skipped, the student loses crucial marks and risks failing.
	4. **Lack of Reflection**: Without closure, the student cannot reflect on what worked or didn’t, which hampers improvement in future projects.
	5. **Waste of Resources:** Resources are planned and allocated for a project. However if projects are not closed properly, it signifies waste of resources utilized over the duration of project, there by resuliting in overall failure of project.

#### <span style="color:blue;">3. What is Testing? Give brief explanation of the main activities involved in Software Testing.</span>
1. Testing is the process of evaluating a software application or system to identify defects, errors or deviations from desired functionality. It involves executing tests, comparing actual results with expected results and analyzing the software's behaviour to ensure it meets the specified requirements and quality standards. Testing helps uncover issues and provides confidence in software's reliability, functionality and performance.
2. Activities involved in software testing:
	1. **Test Planning:** This activity involves defining the objectives, scope and approach for testing. Test planning includes identifying test objectives, test levels, test deliverables, test environments and allocating resources for testing. It also involves creating a test plan document that outlines the overall testing strategy.
	2. **Test Design:** Test design involves creating test cases, test scenarios, and test data based on the software requirements and specifications. Test design ensures that all relevant aspects of the software are covered and that the tests are designed to validate specific functionalities, user interactions and system behaviours.
	3. **Test Execution:** In this activity the designed test cases are executed using appropriate test data and test environments. Test execution involves running the tests, observing the actual results and comparing them against the expected results. Defects or failures are logged and relevant information is documented for further analysis.
	4. **Defect Management:** Defect management involves identifying, reporting and tracking defects found during test execution. Defects are logged in a defect tracking system and information such as defect description, severity, priority and steps to reproduce are recorded. Defects are assigned to development team for resolution and the testing team verifies the fixes.
	5. **Test Closure:** It marks the end of testing activities for a particular software release or project. It involves finalizing test artifacts, summarizing test activities and conducting a review to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement. Test closure ensures that all necessary documentation is completed and provides a basis for future testing efforts.
	6. **Test Maintenance:** It involves updating and adapting the test artifacts to accomodate changes in the software. As the software evolves test cases may need to be modified or new tests created to cover additional functionalities or changes. Test maintenance ensures that the testing efforts remain effective and relevant throughout the software's lifecycle.

#### <span style="color:blue;">4. What is the importance of Software Quality? Discuss six major external software quality characteristics identified by ISO 9126.</span>
1. **Software quality** refers to the degree to which a software product meets the specified requirements, satisfies user needs, and functions reliably under expected conditions.
2. Ensuring software quality is critical for the success of any software product for several reasons:
	1. **User Satisfaction**: High-quality software is more likely to meet the needs and expectations of users
	2. **Cost Efficiency**: Software with fewer defects or issues reduces maintenance costs and the need for frequent bug fixes
	3. **Reliability**: Quality software is more reliable, with fewer system crashes, downtime, or unexpected behaviors.
	4. **Security**: Quality software incorporates proper security measures to protect against vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of cyber-attacks or data breaches.
	5. **Performance**: High-quality software performs well under various conditions, handling high volumes of users or transactions without issues.
	6. **Reputation**: Software defects can negatively impact a company’s reputation. Delivering quality software helps build trust with customers, partners, and other stakeholders.
3. **Six Major External Software Quality Characteristics Identified by ISO 9126:**
	- **Functionality**: Software meets specified requirements and performs intended tasks.
	- **Reliability**: Software consistently performs without failure under specified conditions.
	- **Usability**: Ease of use, learnability, and user satisfaction.
	- **Efficiency**: Optimal use of system resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
	- **Maintainability**: Ease of modification to fix defects or enhance functionality.
	- **Portability**: Ability to operate in different environments or platforms.

#### <span style="color:blue;">5. Discuss reasons for project closure.</span>
There are two mains reasons of project closure:
1. All project goals have been successfully accomplished. The project goals are considered to have been accomplished when all the project deliverables have been handed over to the customers and the customers have confirmed that all objectives have been met.
2. The second reason for project closure is that it has been found that the project is unlikely to achieve its stated objectives and has to be prematurely terminated. The reasons for this can be:
	1. **Lack of Resources:** Resource shortfall for a project may occur due to change in the top management of the company, change of priority of the company due to business reasons, severe financial strain on the company and bankruptcy of the company.
	2. **Changed business need of customer:** The business interests or business process of the customer may change after the initiation of the project. This may make the project outcome not useful in the changed situation.
	3. **Diminishment of perceived benefits:** The expected quantum of benefits of developing software might get altered after the start of the project. This may make the profit projections made during the feasibility study stage to become invalid and may necessitate project termination to reduce losses.
	4. **Scope Creep:** During the software project development it can happen that new features are added to scope other than the planned one's, this is done to add more features to software. However sometimes it can complicate things resulting in difficulty in management, thus leading to project closure.

#### <span style="color:blue;">6. Explain CMM (Capability Maturity Model) with it's various levels.</span>
1. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a developmental model that helps organizations improve their processes and achieve higher levels of maturity.
2. The maturity level of an organization is a ranking of the quality of the development process used by the organization.
3. The CMM helps organizations identify weaknesses in their processes and provides guidelines for improvement.
4. CMM defines five levels of maturity, which represent the progression from an ad hoc and chaotic process to one that is well-defined and continuously improving. These levels are:
	1. **Level 1: Maturity:** At this level, processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive. The organization does not have formal processes, and success often depends on individual effort rather than consistent practices.
	2. **Level 2: Repeatable:** This level of Software Development Organization has a basic and consistent project management processes to track cost, schedule, and functionality.
	3. **Level 3: Defined:** At this level, processes are well-defined, standardized, and documented across the organization. There is an emphasis on process improvement and consistent application of best practices.
	4. **Level 4: Managed:** At this level, the organization uses metrics and quantitative data to manage and improve processes. Statistical techniques are used to control and improve the performance of key processes.
	5. **Level 5 Optimizing:** The highest level of maturity, where the organization focuses on continuous process improvement. The emphasis is on innovation, optimization, and incorporating lessons learned into new processes.

#### <span style="color:blue;">7. Who are the different types of people according to Meredith Belbin needed in order to create a balanced team?</span>
According to Meredith Belbin there are nine different types of people or team roles that are needed to create a balanced team. These roles are based on individual's preferred behaviours, strengths, and contributions in a team. Here are nine different team roles identified by Belbin:
1. **Plant:** These are creative and innovative individuals who generates ideas and solutions. They tend to be imaginative, unconventional and offer unique perspectives.
2. **Monitor Evaluator:** They are analytical thinkers. They have critical eye, assess options carefully and provide rational judgements. They excel at making balanced decisions.
3. **Coordinator:** The coordinator is a strong leader and facilitator. They have excellent communication skills and are adept at coordinating team members, delegating tasks and maintaining focus on team goals.
4. **Resource Investigator:** The Resource Investigator is an outgoing an enthusiastic individual who excels at networking and gathering external information. They are good at making contacts, exploring opportunities and bringing in new resources.
5. **Implementer:** They are reliable and practical team members who turn ideas and plans into action. They are detailed oriented, organized and ensure that tasks are executed efficiently.
6. **Teamworker:** These are cooperative and supportive individuals who fosters harmony within the team. They are empathetic, diplomatic and adept at resolving conflicts. They focus on maintaining good relationships and creating a positive team atmosphere.
7. **Shaper:** The shaper is dynamic and goal oriented team member who pushes the team to achieve results. They are assertive, driven and challenge others to perform at their best.
8. **Complete Finisher:** Complete finisher is a specialist who pays attention to details and ensures that tasks are completed to a high standard. They have a strong sense of responsibility are conscientious and ensure that deadlines are met.
9. **Specialist:** The specialist is an individual with specialized knowledge and skills in a specific area. They provide expert advice and contribute to in-dept expertise to the team. They focus on area of their specialization and provide niche knowledge.

#### <span style="color:blue;">8. Explain chief programmer team and also state its advantages and disadvantages.</span>
1. The **Chief Programmer Team** is a software development team structure where one individual—the **Chief Programmer**—is responsible for the majority of the system's design, coding, and decision-making, while other team members take on more specialized or supportive roles.
2. Key Roles in Chief Programmer Team:
	1. **Chief Programmer:** This person is the primary decision-maker and the lead developer in the team.
	2. **Programmers:** These team members support the Chief Programmer by assisting with coding tasks, handling specific components, or performing routine work.
	3. **Editor:** A person (sometimes a tool) responsible for checking code for syntax errors, maintaining formatting consistency, and handling the integration of various parts of the system.
	4. **Tester:** The tester is responsible for verifying that the code works as expected, finding bugs, and ensuring that the system meets quality standards.
	5. **Support Personnel (Optional):** These roles may include systems analysts, documentation writers, or user interface designers who assist the team with specific areas of the project.
3. **Advantages of the Chief Programmer Team**
	1. **Clear Leadership and Decision-Making**: With a single person holding responsibility for the majority of decisions, the team avoids confusion or conflict around design choices, which can speed up the decision-making process.
	2. **Efficiency in Small Teams**: In smaller teams or projects, the Chief Programmer model is highly efficient since it keeps the decision-making streamlined, and reduces the risk of unnecessary meetings or delays from multiple opinions.
	3. **Specialization of Roles**: The Chief Programmer can focus on high-level design and complex tasks, while other programmers handle specialized tasks. This allows the project to leverage the strengths of each team member.
	4. **Simplified Communication**: Communication tends to be more direct in this model because it is often channeled through the Chief Programmer, which reduces miscommunication and the need for extensive team-wide meetings.
	5. **High Degree of Control**: The Chief Programmer has full control over the project’s direction, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent and adheres to the original vision.
4. **Disadvantages of the Chief Programmer Team**
	1. **Single Point of Failure**: One of the biggest risks is the over-reliance on a single individual. If the Chief Programmer becomes unavailable (due to illness, vacation, or leaving the team), the entire project can be delayed or face significant setbacks.
	2. **Limited Collaboration and Creativity**: The Chief Programmer is often the primary decision-maker, which can limit input from other team members. This structure may stifle collaboration and creativity, as other programmers have less opportunity to contribute to the core design or direction of the project.
	3. **Risk of Burnout**: The Chief Programmer is often responsible for a disproportionate share of the work, which can lead to burnout or mistakes due to the overwhelming workload and constant pressure.
	4. **Inefficiency in Larger Teams**: In larger projects with more complexity, a single person cannot effectively manage all aspects of design, coding, testing, and debugging. The Chief Programmer model may not scale well for large projects, where multiple specialized roles are required.
	5. **Reduced Accountability Across the Team**: With one person in charge of the majority of the critical decisions, other team members may have a diminished sense of accountability for the overall success of the project.

#### <span style="color:blue;">9. Explain the quality attributes according to McCall’s software quality model.</span>
1. McCall defined the quality of software in terms of three broad parameters: its operational characteristic, product revision (how easy it is to fix defect) and product transition (how easy it is to port it different platforms).
2. These three high-level quality attributes are defined based on the following eleven attributes of the software:
	1. Correctness: The extent to which a software product satisfies its specification
	2. Reliability: The probability of the software product working satisfactory over a given duration.
	3. Efficiency: The degree to which the software utilizes system resources (e.g., memory, CPU, bandwidth) effectively.
	4. Integrity: The extent to which the data of the software product remains valid.
	5. Usability: The effort required to operate the software product.
	6. Maintainability: The ease with which it is possible bugs in the software product
	7. Flexibility: The effort required to adapt the software product to changing requirements.
	8. Testability: The effort required to test a software product to ensure that it performs its intended function.
	9. Portability: The effort required to transfer the software product from one hardware or software system environment to another.
	10. Reusability: The extent to which software can be reused in other applications.
	11. Interoperability: The effort required to integrate the software with other software.

#### <span style="color:blue;">10. Differentiate between product versus process quality management.</span>

| Examples include **testing**, **code reviews**, and **user acceptance testing (UAT)**. | Examples include **Agile**, **Six Sigma**, and **CMMI** for process improvement. |
#### <span style="color:blue;">11. Briefly explain the steps involved in conducting a post implementation project review.</span>
1. A **Post-Implementation Project Review** (PIR) is conducted after a project has been completed and the solution has been deployed.
2. Its primary goal is to evaluate the project’s overall success, identify lessons learned, and suggest improvements for future projects.
3. The review ensures that the project's outcomes align with the original objectives and provides insight into areas that could be improved.
4. Below are the key steps involved in conducting a post-implementation project review:
	1. **Conduct Project Survey:** The goal of the project survey is to gather feedback from various stakeholders (team members, end-users, clients, etc.) about their experience with the project.
	2. **Collect Objective Information:** Collecting objective information involves gathering measurable, factual data that helps assess the actual performance of the project against the planned objectives.
	3. **Hold a Debriefing Meeting**: Discuss the project's successes, challenges, and lessons learned in a collaborative meeting.
	4. **Prepare Post-Implementation Review Report**: Summarize findings, lessons learned, and provide recommendations for future projects.
	5. **Publish the report:** The final step is to distribute the post-implementation review report to all relevant stakeholders, so that everyone involved can benefit from the findings and recommendations.

#### <span style="color:blue;">12. What are different types of Team Structure?</span>
Team structure denotes the reporting, responsibility and communication structures in individual project teams. There are three major types of Team Structure:
1. **Chief Programmer Team:** The **Chief Programmer Team** is a software development team structure where one individual—the **Chief Programmer**—is responsible for the majority of the system's design, coding, and decision-making, while other team members take on more specialized or supportive roles.
2. **Democratic Team:** A democratic team structure is characterized by **a leadership style that involves input and decision-making from all team members**. This approach promotes collaboration, open communication, and shared responsibility within the team. It doesn't enforce a formal hierarchy.
3. **Mixed Control Team Structure:** As the name implies, this team structure draw ideas from both democratic and chief programmer team structures. In this structure the problem is decomposed into simple task and then assigned to groups, each group communicates democratically.

#### <span style="color:blue;">13. What is ISO standard? What are sub characteristics of Functionalities and Reliability of ISO 9126 software qualities.</span>
An **ISO standard** is a set of international guidelines or criteria established by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. These standards are developed to ensure quality, safety, efficiency, and consistency in various products, services, and systems.
**ISO/IEC 9126** is an international standard for the evaluation of software quality. It defines a model for software quality characteristics and provides guidelines for measuring and assessing these qualities.
1. **Sub-characteristics of Functionality (ISO 9126)**
	Functionality refers to the ability of the software to perform its intended tasks and meet the requirements it was designed for. It includes how well the software delivers the required features and functions.
	1. **Suitability**: The degree to which the software meets the specified needs and requirements.
	2. **Accuracy**: The degree to which the software performs the required operations correctly, with no errors or discrepancies.
	3. **Interoperability**: The ability of the software to work with other systems or software without issues (e.g., sharing data, integration).
	4. **Security**: The ability of the software to protect against unauthorized access or malicious actions.
	5. **Functionality Compliance**: The extent to which the software conforms to external standards, regulations, or laws relevant to its operation.
2. **Sub-characteristics of Reliability (ISO 9126)**
	Reliability measures how consistently the software performs its intended functions over time under specified conditions. It reflects the software's ability to function without failure.
	1. **Maturity**: The frequency of software defects or failures; a mature system is less likely to encounter critical defects.
	2. **Fault Tolerance**: The ability of the software to continue operating correctly in the presence of faults or errors.
	3. **Recoverability**: The software's ability to recover from failures or errors, restoring itself to a proper state.
	4. **Availability**: The proportion of time the software is available and functioning as expected (i.e., uptime).

#### <span style="color:blue;">14. Describe a virtual team and the advantages of forming a virtual team.</span>
1. A virtual team, also known as geographically dispersed team (gdt) - is a group of individuals who work across time, space and organizational boundary with links strengthened by webs of communication technology.
2. They have complementary skills and are committed to a common purpose, have interdependent performance goals and share an approach to work for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
3. Members of a virtual team collaborate via tools like email, video conferencing, instant messaging, cloud-based file sharing, and project management software.
4. Geographically dispersed teams allow organizations to hire and retain the best people regardless of location.
5. **Advantages of Forming Virtual Team:**
	1. **Access to a Global Talent Pool**: By forming a virtual team, you are not limited by geographical constraints. This opens up the possibility of recruiting skilled professionals from all over the world, allowing for more diverse expertise, innovative solutions, and varied perspectives.
	2. **Flexibility and Work-Life Balance**: Virtual team members can work from the comfort of their homes or any location of their choosing, which can improve work-life balance and job satisfaction.
	3. **24/7 Work Capability**: Since team members may be spread across different time zones, virtual teams can continue working around the clock.
	4. **Environmental Benefits**: Reduced commuting means fewer carbon emissions, contributing to sustainability efforts. Virtual teams can support a company’s "green" initiatives by cutting down on the environmental footprint.
	5. **Faster Scaling and Adaptability**: Virtual teams can be more easily scaled up or down depending on project requirements. Organizations can bring in specialists for specific tasks without the logistical challenges of relocating or onboarding employees to a physical office.
6. Challenges to Consider: While there are many advantages to virtual teams, it’s also important to recognize potential challenges, such as:
	- **Communication Barriers**: The lack of face-to-face interaction can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or difficulty in building team rapport.
	- **Time Zone Differences**: Coordinating meetings and collaborating across different time zones can be challenging, especially for teams spread over large geographical areas.
	- **Isolation**: Remote workers may feel isolated or disconnected from the company culture and colleagues, which can affect morale.
	- **Technology Issues**: Dependence on digital tools means that technical issues like poor internet connections or software glitches can disrupt communication and work.

#### <span style="color:blue;">15. Explain the metrics correlated with software reliability.</span>
Reliability metrics are used to quantitatively expressed the reliability of the software product.
Some reliability metrics which can be used to quantify the reliability of the software product are as follows:
1. **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):** It is the time interval between two successive failures, averaged over a large number of failures. An **MTTF** of 200 mean that one failure can be expected each 200-time units. The time units are entirely dependent on the system & it can even be stated in the number of transactions. **MTTF** is consistent for systems with large transactions.
2. **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Once failure occurs, some-time is required to fix the error. **MTTR** measures the average time it takes to track the errors causing the failure and to fix them.
3. **Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):** The MTTF and MTTR metrics can be combined to get the MTBF metric:
	**MTBF = MTTF + MTTR**
	Thus, an **MTBF** of 300 denoted that once the failure appears, the next failure is expected to appear only after 300 hours. In this method, the time measurements are real-time & not the execution time as in **MTTF**.
4. **Rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF):** It is the number of failures appearing in a unit time interval. The number of unexpected events over a specific time of operation. **ROCOF** is the frequency of occurrence with which unexpected role is likely to appear. A **ROCOF** of 0.02 mean that two failures are likely to occur in each 100 operational time unit steps. It is also called the failure intensity metric.
5. **Probability of Failure on Demand (POFOD):** **POFOD** is described as the probability that the system will fail when a service is requested. It is the number of system deficiency given several systems inputs. **POFOD** is the possibility that the system will fail when a service request is made. A **POFOD** of 0.1 means that one out of ten service requests may fail.**POFOD** is an essential measure for safety-critical systems. POFOD is relevant for protection systems where services are demanded occasionally.
6. **Availability (AVAIL):** Availability is the probability that the system is applicable for use at a given time. It takes into account the repair time & the restart time for the system. An availability of 0.995 means that in every 1000 time units, the system is feasible to be available for **995** of these. The percentage of time that a system is applicable for use, taking into account planned and unplanned downtime. If a system is down an average of four hours out of 100 hours of operation, its **AVAIL** is 96%.

#### <span style="color:blue;">16. State four popular process capability models and explain any one of them.</span>

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specialization and Expertise** | Employees focus on specific areas, allowing them to develop deep expertise and efficiency. In project organizations, this is harder to achieve due to task variety.      |
| **Efficient Resource Utilization** | Resources are continually used within their functions, ensuring no idle time. Project organizations may have underutilized resources between projects.                  |
| **Clear Chain of Command**   | Reporting lines are clear with functional managers overseeing their departments, which simplifies decision-making. Project organizations may have multiple reporting lines. |
| **Better Control and Supervision** | Functional managers focus on specific departments, making it easier to monitor performance and ensure quality. Project organizations often complicate supervision.        |
| **Reduced Redundancy**       | There is less duplication of effort because functions operate independently, avoiding repetitive tasks. Project organizations might duplicate tasks for each project.       |
| **Career Development and Training** | Employees have clear career paths in specialized roles, allowing for growth. In project organizations, roles can shift frequently, hindering structured career development. |
| **Stability and Predictability** | Operations are ongoing, creating stability and predictability. Project organizations can experience fluctuations with project start and end times.                        |
| **Simplified Communication and Coordination** | Communication is smoother within specialized functions, reducing misunderstandings. Project organizations involve cross-functional teams, complicating communication.   |
| **Easier Integration of New Employees** | New hires are trained in specific roles with established processes, making onboarding easier. In project organizations, employees must adapt to temporary roles.        |
| **Cost-Effectiveness in Large Operations** | Resources are used efficiently across functions, achieving economies of scale. Project organizations may incur higher costs by creating separate teams for each project.   |
