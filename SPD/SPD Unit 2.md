#### <span style="color:blue;">1. Describe the spiral model with the help of diagram and give the advantages and disadvantages of it.</span>
![Spiral Model](https://github.com/ggk570/Bsc-IT-Sem-5/blob/main/SPD/Images/Spiral%20Model.png)
1. The Spiral Model is a combination of the waterfall model and the iterative model. It provides support for **Risk Handling**.
2. It provides a systematic and iterative approach to software development.
3. In its diagrammatic representation, looks like a spiral with many loops. The exact number of loops of the spiral is unknown and can vary from project to project. Each loop of the spiral is called a ****phase**** of the software development process.
4. The Spiral Model is a risk-driven model, meaning that the focus is on managing risk through multiple iterations of the software development process. It consists of the following phases:
	1. **Determine Objective:** In first phase of the spiral model we clarify what the project aims to achieve, including functional and non-functional requirements.
	2. **Identify and resolve risks:** In the risk analysis phase, the risks associated with the project are identified and evaluated.
	3. **Development and Test:** In this phase, the software is developed based on the requirements gathered in the previous iteration and proper testing is done.
	4. **Planning:** The next iteration of the spiral begins with a new planning phase, based on the results of the evaluation.
5. Advantages of the Spiral Model
	1. **Risk Management**: Continuous risk assessment helps identify potential issues early, allowing for timely mitigation.
	2. **Flexibility**: Accommodates changes in requirements throughout the development process, making it suitable for projects with evolving needs.
	3. **User Involvement**: Frequent iterations encourage user feedback, leading to a product that better meets user expectations.
	4. **Incremental Delivery**: Features can be developed and delivered in increments, which can be particularly beneficial for large projects.
	5. **Documentation**: Promotes thorough documentation at each phase, which can be useful for future maintenance.
6. Disadvantages of the Spiral Model
	1. **Complexity**: The model can be complex to manage and may require significant expertise to implement effectively.
	2. **Cost**: It may be more expensive than other models due to its extensive risk assessment and documentation requirements.
	3. **Time-Consuming**: The iterative nature can lead to extended development times, especially for projects with multiple spirals.
	4. **Risk of Incomplete Evaluations**: If risk assessment and evaluations are not thoroughly conducted, critical issues may be overlooked.
	5. **Not Suitable for Small Projects**: The overhead of documentation and risk management may not be justified for smaller projects.

#### <span style="color:blue;">2. Define atern/dynamic systems development method. State and explain eight core principles of it.</span>
1. The Atern/Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework used primarily in software development.
2. It focuses on delivering business value quickly while ensuring quality through iterative and incremental development.
3. DSDM emphasizes collaboration among stakeholders and prioritizes user involvement throughout the project lifecycle.
4. Eight Core Principles of Atern/DSDM
	1. **Focus on Business Need:** The primary goal is to deliver the best business value. All project activities should align with the needs and objectives of the organization, ensuring that the final product meets user requirements and contributes to business goals.
	2. **Deliver on Time:** Time is a critical constraint in DSDM. Projects are divided into time-boxed phases, ensuring that deliverables are completed within set timeframes. This principle encourages teams to prioritize tasks and manage scope effectively.
	3. **Collaborate:** Active collaboration among stakeholders, including users, developers, and business representatives, is essential. This principle fosters communication and ensures that all parties are involved in decision-making, leading to better outcomes and shared ownership of the project.
	4. **Never compromise quality:** Quality should not be sacrificed for speed. DSDM emphasizes maintaining high standards throughout the project, with testing integrated into every phase. This ensures that the product is not only delivered on time but also meets quality expectations.
	5. **Build Incrementally from Firm Foundations:** The method advocates for developing the project in incremental phases. Each iteration builds on a stable base, allowing for adjustments based on feedback while minimizing the risk of significant deviations from initial goals.
	6. **Develop Iteratively**: Iterative development allows teams to refine the product based on user feedback. Frequent iterations help identify issues early, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements.
	7. **Communicate Continuously and Clearly**: Clear and ongoing communication is vital for the success of DSDM projects. Regular updates, open discussions, and transparent sharing of information help keep all stakeholders informed and aligned.
	8. **Demonstrate Control**: Effective project control is necessary to manage risks and ensure that the project remains on track. DSDM promotes the use of tools and techniques to monitor progress, manage changes, and make informed decisions throughout the development process.

#### <span style="color:blue;">3. Discuss agile and scrum as a fast delivery approach of a project in detail.</span>
1. Agile and Scrum are widely recognized project management methodologies in software development that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and fast delivery of projects.
2. **Agile Methodology:** Agile is a project management approach designed to manage software development in a flexible and efficient way. It focuses on delivering small and workable parts of the project frequently, rather than delivering the entire project at once. The methodology emphasizes customer collaboration, adaptive planning, and rapid delivery.
	Key Values of Agile:
	1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**: Prioritizing people and communication fosters a collaborative environment.
	2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**: Delivering functional software is more valuable than extensive documentation.
	3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**: Engaging customers throughout the project leads to better outcomes and satisfaction.
	4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**: Flexibility to adapt to changes in requirements is crucial for success.
3. **Scrum Framework:** Scrum is a specific Agile framework that provides a structured approach to managing complex projects, particularly in software development. It emphasizes iterative progress through short cycles called Sprints.
4. Key Components of Scrum:

	    - **Product Owner**: Defines the project vision, sets priorities, and represents stakeholders.
	    - **Development Team**: A cross-functional team responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.
	2. **Artifacts**:
	    - **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of tasks, features, and bug fixes that need to be completed.
	    - **Sprint Backlog**: A set of tasks chosen from the Product Backlog to be completed during a sprint.
	    - **Increment**: The sum of all completed work at the end of a sprint, representing progress.
	3. **Events**:
	    - **Sprint**: A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.
	    - **Sprint Planning**: A meeting where the team discusses what will be accomplished during the Sprint.
	    - **Daily Scrum**: A short (15-minute) stand-up meeting where team members share progress, plans, and any obstacles.
	    - **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the Sprint to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
	    - **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting where the team reflects on the past Sprint, discussing what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.
5. Benefits of Agile and Scrum:
	1. **Increased Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile allows teams to respond to changing requirements, which is essential in dynamic environments. Scrum's iterative approach means teams can pivot based on feedback.

#### <span style="color:blue;">4. Describe the COCOMO II and discuss its stages.</span>
1. COCOMO II (Constructive Cost Model II) is a widely used software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm and his colleagues.
2. It helps organizations estimate the cost, effort, and schedule for software projects based on various project attributes
3. COCOMO II is an evolution of the original COCOMO model and incorporates new software development practices, such as rapid application development and the use of modern programming languages.
4. Stages of COCOMO II: 
	1. **Application Composition Model:** 
		- This stage is used for projects that involve the development of software using existing components, frameworks, or tools. It focuses on quick estimates during the early stages of project planning.
		- It considers factors like the size of the software in terms of function points, the complexity of the application, and the experience of the team.
	2. **Early Design Model:**
		- This stage is used for estimating projects at a higher level of detail, typically after some initial design work has been completed.
		- It factors in the size of the software in lines of code (LOC) or function points and adjusts for various cost drivers (such as reliability, database size, and personnel capability).
		- This model provides more accuracy than the Application Composition Model by incorporating design attributes and considerations.
	3. **Post Architectural Model:**
		- This is the most detailed stage, used when a project has a well-defined architecture and detailed specifications.
		- It offers the most accurate estimates, taking into account a comprehensive set of cost drivers, including product attributes, hardware characteristics, personnel attributes, and project attributes.
		- The Post-Architecture Model uses equations to estimate effort and schedule based on size and various influencing factors.
5. **Strengths:**
	1. **Versatile:** It can be applied to projects of varying size, type and complexities.
	2. **Detailed:** It accounts various factors that can affect the software development effort and cost.
	3. **Accurate:** It is more accurate as compared to it's previous version.
6. **Weaknesses:**
	1. **Complexity:** It is more complex than it's prior version because it accounts for more factors.
	2. **Data Dependent:** It is dependent on data for accurate estimations.

#### <span style="color:blue;">5. Describe the Capers Jones estimating rules of thumb with the help of relevant examples.</span>
1. Capers Jones, a prominent figure in software engineering and project management, developed several "rules of thumb" for estimating software development effort, cost, and schedule.
2. These rules are based on extensive industry data and empirical observations.
3. Capers Jones Estimating Rules Key Points:
	1. **Size Matters:** The size of the software (measured in lines of code or function points) is one of the most significant factors affecting the cost and effort of development. Larger projects typically require more time and resources.
	2. **Experience Counts:** The experience level of the development team can greatly impact the efficiency and productivity of the project. More experienced teams are likely to deliver projects faster and with fewer defects.
	3. **Technology Impact:** The choice of technology and tools influences development speed and efficiency. Using familiar or advanced technologies can reduce the time required to complete the project.
	4. **Defect Density:** The number of defects per lines of code (defect density) can be an indicator of the quality of the software. Higher defect densities can lead to increased effort in testing and fixing issues.
	5. **Productivity Factors:** Factors such as team communication, working environment, and project management practices can significantly affect the productivity of the team and the overall success of the project.
	6. **Historical Data:** Using historical data from past projects can provide valuable insights into estimating future projects. Similar projects can provide benchmarks for effort, cost, and timelines.
4. Capers Jones Rules of Thumb for Software Estimation:
	1. **Function Point Analysis:** Use function points to estimate the size and complexity of the software. This method provides a standardized way to measure the functional requirements.
	2. **Effort Distribution:** Typically, 15-25% of the total effort is spent on requirements gathering and analysis, 30-40% on design, 30-40% on coding, and 10-20% on testing.
	3. **Defect Removal:** Aim to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. Early detection reduces the cost and effort of fixing issues later.
	4. **Estimation Accuracy:** Initial estimates should be revisited and refined as the project progresses. Estimation accuracy improves with more detailed information about requirements and design.
	5. **Team Size:** The optimal team size for a software project is usually between 5 and 10 members. Larger teams can lead to communication challenges and decreased productivity.
5. Capers Jones estimating rules of thumb is written as follows: 
	- **Rule 1:** Equivalence of SLOC Function Points for C programs, one function point equals 125 SLOC.
	- **Rule 2:** Calculate the Project Duration. The development period is roughly predicted by Function Points raised to the power of 0.4 in calendar months.
	- **Rule 3:** From the design to the coding phases, users need to creep in at a pace of about 2% per month on average.
	- **Rule 4:** Defect Removal Efficiency 30% of all bugs will be found and fixed during each program review, inspection, or test stage.
	- **Rule 5:** Calculate the projected workforce. The number of employees needed to construct the program is roughly predicted by dividing the size of the software by 150.
	- **Rule 6:** Calculate the effort involved in developing software. The software development time multiplied by the required staff headcount yields the approximate number of staff months needed to produce software.
	- **Rule 7:** The number of employees needed to do routine maintenance tasks is roughly predicted by dividing the function points by 500.

#### <span style="color:blue;">6. Explain briefly Albrecht/IFPUG function point and solve the following. For an organization, the following table summarizes the weightings to be used for computing function points measures of a software having the following characteristics. Number of user inputs: 10 (simple), Number of user outputs: 7 (simple), Number of user enquires: 3 (average), Number of files: 6 (average), Number of External Interfaces: 1 (complex). Calculate unadjusted function point measures of the size of the software system?</span>
1. The **Albrecht/IFPUG Function Point** method is a standardized approach for measuring the functional size of software.
2. It assesses the software's functionality from the user's perspective, allowing for a more accurate estimation of effort and resources required for development and maintenance.
3. The IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group) is an organization that promotes the use of function points and provides guidelines for their measurement.
4. **Key Aspects of Albrecht Function Points / IFPUG:**
	1. **Measurement of Functionality:** Function points assess the size of a software application based on its functional requirements, rather than lines of code or technical aspects. This makes it a user-centric metric.
	2. **Components of Function Points:** Function points are categorized into two main types: 
		- **Data Functions:** This includes Internal Logical Files (ILFs) and External Interface Files (EIFs) that represent data stored and referenced by the application.
		- **Transactional Functions:** This includes External Inputs (EIs), External Outputs (EOs), and User Inquiries (UIs) that represent user interactions with the system.
	3. **Complexity Weighing:** Each component is assigned a complexity weight (low, average, high), which helps in calculating the total function points for a system. This allows for a more nuanced view of the software’s functionality. 
	4. **Usage in Estimation:** Function points are commonly used for estimating project effort, cost, and duration. They provide a standardized way to compare different projects and assess productivity.
	5. **Quality Assurance:** By using function points, organizations can ensure better quality control in software development. This metric helps in defining requirements clearly and aligning development with user needs.
	6. **Benchmarking:** Function points can be used to benchmark productivity across different teams or projects, helping organizations to identify areas for improvement.
5. Function points are derived from five key components:
	1. **User Inputs (UI)**: Data received from users.
	2. **User Outputs (UO)**: Data sent to users.
	3. **User Enquiries (UE)**: Requests for information that involve both inputs and outputs.
	4. **Internal Logical Files (ILF)**: User-identifiable groups of related data stored within the application.
	5. **External Interface Files (EIF)**: User-identifiable groups of related data that are maintained by other applications.
6. **Weightings:** Each of these components is assigned a weight based on its complexity (simple, average, complex). The weights are usually defined as follows (these can vary slightly based on specific organizational or IFPUG guidelines):

| Measurement Parameter    | Simple | Average | Complex |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| External Inputs          | 3      | 4       | 6       |
| External Outputs         | 4      | 5       | 7       |
| External Inquiries       | 3      | 4       | 6       |
| Internal Logical Files   | 7      | 10      | 15      |
| External Interface Files | 5      | 7       | 10      |
7. Calculation of Unadjusted Function Points
	Using the provided characteristics:
	- **User Inputs**: 10 (simple) → 10 * 3 = 30
	- **User Outputs**: 7 (simple) → 7 * 4 = 28
	- **User Enquiries**: 3 (average) → 3 * 4 = 12
	- **Internal Logical Files**: 6 (average) → 6 * 10 = 60
	- **External Interface Files**: 1 (complex) → 1 * 10 = 10
8. Total Calculation
	Now, we sum these values to get the Unadjusted Function Point (UFP) total:
	UFP = User Inputs + User Outputs + User Enquiries +  Internal Logical Files + External Interface Files
	
	UFP = 30 + 28 + 12 + 60 + 10 = 140
9. The **Unadjusted Function Point measure** for the software system is **140** function points. This measurement can help in estimating development effort and project planning.

#### <span style="color:blue;">7. How uncertainity can be associated with products, processes or resources of a project?</span>
1. Uncertainty in a project refers to the lack of knowledge about future events that can affect project outcomes.
2. This uncertainty can arise from various factors associated with products, processes, and resources. Understanding these uncertainties is crucial for effective project management and risk mitigation.
3. Here's a breakdown of how each aspect can introduce uncertainty:
	 1. **Product Uncertainty:** This relates to the unpredictability regarding the final product’s features, performance, and quality.
		- **Causes:**
			- **Changing Requirements:** Client or stakeholder requirements may change during development, leading to uncertainty about what the final product should entail.
			- **Technological Changes:** Rapid advancements in technology can render certain features obsolete or create new opportunities that need to be incorporated.
			- **Market Demand:** Uncertainties in market trends can affect product viability, leading to risks in whether the product will be accepted by users.
	2. **Process Uncertainty:** This involves unpredictability in how the project will be executed, including the methodologies and tools used.
		- **Causes:**
			- **Methodology Selection:** Choosing an inappropriate project management methodology can lead to inefficiencies and unanticipated issues.
			- **Team Dynamics:** Changes in team composition, skills, and communication can affect process execution, leading to unforeseen delays or quality issues. 
			- **External Factors:** Regulations, compliance requirements, and external dependencies (like third-party vendors) can introduce uncertainty in process execution.
	3. **Resources Uncertainty:** This pertains to the unpredictability of availability and performance of the resources required for the project.
		- **Causes:**
			- **Resource Availability:** Changes in the availability of key personnel, equipment, or materials can impact project timelines.
			- **Budget Constraints:** Financial uncertainties, such as fluctuating costs or budget cuts, can limit resource allocation.
			- **Supplier Reliability:** Dependence on external suppliers for materials or services introduces risk, as their reliability can be unpredictable.

1. The **One-Shot Process Model**, also known as the **One-Shot Development Model** or **Waterfall Model**, is a traditional approach to software development that emphasizes a linear and sequential progression through various phases.
2. Phases of the One-Shot Process Model
	1. **Requirements Gathering**:
	    - Collect and document all functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. This phase sets the foundation for the entire project.
	2. **System Design**:
	    - Based on the gathered requirements, the system architecture and design are created. This includes both high-level design (system architecture) and low-level design (detailed component design).
	3. **Implementation (Coding)**:
	    - Developers write the code according to the design specifications. This phase often involves multiple programming tasks, which may be handled by different team members.
	4. **Verification (Testing)**:
	    - The completed software is tested against the requirements to ensure that it functions as intended. This phase includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
	5. **Deployment:**
		- In this phase the software is deployed for customers use.
	6. **Maintenance**:
	    - After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it may receive updates, bug fixes, or enhancements based on user feedback and changing requirements.
3. Advantages
	- **Simplicity**: The linear nature of the model makes it easy to understand and manage.
	- **Clear Structure**: Each phase has specific deliverables and milestones, facilitating planning and tracking.
	- **Ideal for Small Projects**: Works well for projects with clear, unchanging requirements and a straightforward scope.
4. Disadvantages
	- **Inflexibility**: Changes in requirements after the process begins can be difficult and costly to implement.
	- **Late Testing**: Testing occurs only after implementation, which can lead to discovering significant issues late in the process.
	- **Not Suitable for Complex Projects**: Projects with high uncertainty or evolving requirements may struggle with this model.

#### <span style="color:blue;">9. Explain the reasons why estimates are carried out at various stages of software project.</span>
1. Estimates are carried out at various stages of a software project for several reasons, which help in planning, decision-making and ensuring project success. Here are some key reasons why estimates are conducted at different stages of a software project.
	1. **Feasibility Estimation:** Initial estimates allow stakeholders to assess whether the project is feasible or not within the available resources and timeframes.
	2. **Resource Allocation:** Early estimates help determine the resources (time, budget, personnel) needed for the project, facilitating effective allocation and scheduling. Thus playing an important role in project's success.
	3. **Risk Management:** Early and ongoing estimates help uncover potential challenges and risks associated with complexity, resource availability, and technology. By recognizing risks early, teams can develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
	4. **Cost Estimation**: Estimates provide a basis for budgeting, helping organizations allocate financial resources appropriately and ensuring that sufficient funds are available for all project phases.
	5. **Contract Negotiation:** Estimates are often required during contract negotiation with clients or suppliers. Accurate estimates help in setting realistic expectations, determining pricing structures and ensuring that contracts are financially viable for all parties involved. Estimates provide a basis for negotiation and help in establishing mutually agreed upon terms and conditions.

#### <span style="color:blue;">10. Explain major shortcomings of the SLOC measure.</span>
1. **Source Lines of Code (SLOC)** is a common metric used to measure the size of software applications based on the number of lines of code written.
2. While SLOC can provide useful insights, it also has several major shortcomings:
	1. **Quality Ignored**
		- **No Measure of Quality**: SLOC counts lines of code but does not account for the quality of the code. A project with a high SLOC might have numerous bugs or poorly structured code, which could lead to higher maintenance costs and lower overall performance.
	2. **Different Languages and Paradigms**
		- **Inconsistent Measures Across Languages**: Different programming languages have varying levels of verbosity and syntax complexity. For example, a single line in a high-level language like Python might accomplish what requires many lines in a lower-level language like C. This inconsistency makes comparisons between projects written in different languages problematic.
	3. **Maintenance and Comments**
		- **Inclusion of Non-Functional Code**: SLOC counts all lines, including comments, blank lines, and lines that do not contribute to the functionality of the software. This can inflate the count without providing meaningful insights into actual functionality.
	4. **No Consideration of Complexity**
		- **Lack of Complexity Assessment**: SLOC does not consider the complexity of the code. Two projects with the same SLOC can have vastly different levels of complexity, affecting maintainability, scalability, and performance.
	5. **Focus on Output Rather Than Outcomes**
		- **Productivity Misalignment**: SLOC emphasizes output (i.e., the number of lines written) rather than outcomes (i.e., user satisfaction, functionality delivered). This can lead to a misguided focus on writing more code rather than delivering value.
	6. **Neglect of Non-Code Contributions**
		- **Exclusion of Other Efforts**: SLOC fails to capture significant contributions to software development, such as design, requirements analysis, testing, and documentation efforts. These aspects are critical for project success but are not reflected in code counts.
	7. **Evolving Requirements**
		- **Static Measurement**: SLOC is a static measure that does not account for changing requirements over time. Agile and iterative development processes may lead to significant changes in functionality without a proportional increase in code lines.
	8. **Encourages Poor Practices**
		- **Potential for "Code Bloat"**: Relying on SLOC as a measure of productivity can encourage developers to write more lines of code unnecessarily, leading to code bloat and reduced maintainability.

#### <span style="color:blue;">11. What are the ways to determine the staffing requirement of a software project?</span>
1. Determining the staffing requirements for a software project is essential for successful project execution.
2. Here are several methods to assess how many and what types of staff are needed:
	1. **Project Scope and Complexity:** Analyze the project’s scope and complexity. Larger and more complex projects typically require more staff with diverse skills. Break down the project into phases and estimate the number of personnel needed for each phase based on the tasks involved.
	2. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Create a Work Breakdown Structure that outlines all the tasks required to complete the project. For each task, identify the skills needed and estimate the effort required, which can help in calculating the number of staff needed. 
	3. **Historical Data Analysis:** Review historical data from similar past projects. Analyze how many people were required and the types of roles involved. This can provide insights into staffing needs based on previous experiences.
	4. **Expert Judgment:** Consult with experienced project managers or team leads who can provide estimates based on their past experiences and knowledge of the project’s requirements.
	5. **Resource Allocation Models:** Use resource allocation models or software tools that help in estimating staffing needs based on project parameters like timeline, budget, and resource availability. These models can provide data-driven recommendations.
	6. **Agile Estimation Techniques:** In Agile projects, techniques like Planning Poker or T-shirt sizing can help teams estimate the effort required for user stories, leading to a clearer understanding of staffing needs.
	7. **Skill Set Analysis:** Assess the specific skill sets required for the project and determine how many staff members possess those skills. This can help identify any gaps that need to be filled.
	8. **Team Capacity Planning:** Evaluate the current team members’ capacity and availability. Understand their existing workloads to determine how many additional staff are required to meet project demands.

#### <span style="color:blue;">12. Discuss the common problem faced during effort estimation.</span>
1. Effort estimation is a crucial part of project management, especially in software development. However, several common problems can arise during this process, leading to inaccurate estimates and project challenges.
2. **Common Problems in Effort Estimation**
	1. **Lack of Historical Data:** When teams do not have access to past project data, it becomes difficult to make accurate predictions. Historical data is vital for benchmarking and improving estimation accuracy.
	2. **Inadequate Requirements:** Unclear or incomplete requirements can lead to significant discrepancies in effort estimation. If the project scope is not well-defined, it can result in underestimating or overestimating the required effort.
	3. **Optimism Bias:** Teams often fall into the trap of optimism bias, where they underestimate the time and resources needed to complete tasks. This can lead to unrealistic timelines and budget overruns.
	4. **Scope Creep:** Changes in project scope during development can drastically affect effort estimation. If new features or requirements are added after the initial estimation, it can lead to increased effort and delays.
	5. **Team Experience Variability:** Different team members may have varying levels of experience and skill, affecting productivity. Inconsistent team performance can make it challenging to predict overall project effort accurately.
	6. **Technological Challenges:** Unfamiliarity with new technologies or tools can impact development speed and efficiency. If a team is not well-versed in the required technology, it can lead to underestimation of effort.
	7. **Interdependencies:** Projects often involve multiple teams and dependencies. If one team encounters delays, it can impact the entire project timeline, complicating effort estimation.
	8. **Lack of Collaboration:** Poor communication among team members can lead to misunderstandings regarding project requirements and expectations, resulting in inaccurate estimates.
