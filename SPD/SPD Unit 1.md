#### <span style="color:blue;">1. Define project. Describe the project management life cycle with the help of diagram and state the W5HH principle.</span>
1. A **project** is a endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has a defined beginning and end, specific objectives, constraints (such as time, cost, and quality), and involves a set of activities that are coordinated to achieve the desired outcome.
2. **Project Management Life Cycle:**
	![[Project Management LifeCycle.png]]
	1. **Initiation:** During the project initiation phase it is crucial for the champions of the project to develop a thorough understanding of the important characteristics of the project. This phase defines the project, problems and details on what need to be done.
	2. **Planning:** The planning phase is the foundation for the project. This is when you detail all the work, how you plan on doing it and what resources you'll need to meet project goals.
	   In this phase various plans are made :
		• Project plan : Assign project resources and time frames to the tasks.
		• Resource plan : List the resources, manpower and equipment that required to execute the project.
		• Financial plan : plan for manpower, equipment and other costs.
		• Quality plan : Plan of quality targets and control.
		• Risk plan : Identification of the potential risks, their prioritization and a plan for the actions	that would be taken to contain the different risks.
	3. **Execution:** In this phase we would be implementing the project plan by coordinating resources and activities.
	4. **Monitoring and controlling:** This phase goes hand in hand with execution phase, it's about monitoring project's overall progress to see if we are meeting project's objectives and are on track.
	5. **Closure:** It involves completing the release of all the required deliverables to the customer along with the Necessary documentation. Subsequently, all the project resources are released and supply agreements with the vendors are terminated and all the pending payments are completed.
3. **W5HH Principle**
	1. The W5HH principle in software management exists to help project managers guide objectives, timelines, responsibilities, management styles, and resources.
	2. The **W5HH principle** outlines a series of questions that can help project managers more efficiently manage software projects.
	3. The series of questions are:
		1. **Why?** - Why is the system being developed?
			This focuses a team on the business reasons for developing the software.
		2. **What?** - What will be done?
			This is the guiding principle in determining the tasks that need to be completed.
		3. **When?** When will it be completed?
			This includes important milestones and the timeline for the project.
		4. **Who?** Who is responsible for each function?
			This is where you determine which team member takes on which responsibilities. You may also identify external stakeholders with a claim in the project.
		5. **Where?** Where are they organizationally located?
			This step gives you time to determine what other stakeholders have a role in the project and where they are found.
		6. **How?** How will the job be done technically and managerially?
			In this step, a strategy for developing the software and managing the project is concluded upon.
		7. **How much?** How much of each resource is needed?
			The goal of this step is to figure out the number of resources necessary to complete the project.

#### <span style="color:blue;">2. What is project product? Explain the product breakdown structure with the help of example.</span>
1. A **project product** refers to the end result or deliverable of a project. It is the specific output that the project is intended to produce, which can be a product, service, or outcome that meets defined requirements and fulfills the project's objectives.
2. **Product Breakdown Structure:**
	1. A **Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)** is a hierarchical decomposition of the project product into its components.
	2. This structure helps in organizing and defining the deliverables of a project, making it easier to understand the relationships between different parts and manage the work involved in creating them.
	3. **Benefits of Using PBS:**
		- **Clarity**: Provides a clear visual representation of the project product and its components.

#### <span style="color:blue;">4. How to evaluate and manage risk in software project management? Explain.</span>
1. "Tomorrow problems are today's risk." Hence, a clear definition of a "risk" is a problem that could cause some loss or threaten the progress of the project, but which has not happened yet.
2. These potential issues might harm cost, schedule or technical success of the project and the quality of our software device, or project team morale.
3. Risk Management is the system of identifying addressing and eliminating these problems before they can damage the project.
4. Steps to evaluate and manage risk:
	1. **Risk Identification:** Risk identification involves brainstorming activities. It also involves the preparation of a risk list. Brainstorming is a group discussion technique where all the stakeholders and team members meet together. This technique produces new ideas and promotes creative thinking. Preparation of a risk list involves the identification of risks that are occurring continuously in previous software projects.
	2. **Risk Analysis and Prioritization:** In this step analysis and prioritization of risk is done. This helps in qualitative and quantitative evaluation of risk by listing the risks, their probability of occurrence, identifying the impact of the risk. These data helps in prioritization of risks and it is maintained for further risk management steps.
	3. **Risk Mitigation:** The purpose of this technique is to eliminate the occurrence of risks. Various strategies can be used to mitigate various types of risks. E.g We can reduce the scope of the project by removing non-essential requirements, there by mitigating associated risks.
	4. **Risk Monitoring:** In this technique, the risk is monitored continuously by reevaluating the risks, the impact of risk, and the probability of occurrence of the risk.

#### <span style="color:blue;">5. Describe the main steps of step wise approach to planning software projects with the help of diagram.</span>
![[Step-Wise Project Planning.png]]
1. The stepwise project planning approach is a structured method for managing projects that breaks down the planning process into a series of sequential steps
2. A typical stepwise project plan has 10 steps, including:
	1. **Select Project:** This is called Step 0 because in a way it is outside the main project planning process. Projects are not initiated out of thin air - some activity has to take place before deciding that this project rather than another is worth undertaking. This project evaluation may be done on an individual basis or as part of strategic planning.
	2. **Identify Project Scope and Objectives:** This phase is to define the goals and objectives of your project. Project goals and objectives help you decide if the project should be prioritized (or even undertaken). They also assist you in deciding the scope of project i.e what to deliver to the client and what not to deliver.
	3. **Identify Project Infrastructure:** Projects are rarely initiated in a vacuum. There is usually some kind of existing infrastructure into which the project can fit. The project leader who does not already know about this structure needs to find out its precise nature. This step involves:
		1. **Identify relationship between project and strategic planning**
		2. **Identify installation standards and procedures.**
		3. **Identify project team organization.**
	4. **Analyze Project Characteristics:** It helps to understand the unique aspects of the project that will influence planning and execution.

		2. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down the work required to create the deliverables into manageable activities.
		3. **Activity Sequencing:** Determine the logical order of activities and dependencies.
	5. **Estimate Effort for Each Activity:** Estimate the time and resources required to complete each project activity.
		**Key Activities:**
		1. **Effort Estimation:** Use techniques such as expert judgment, historical data, and estimation models to estimate effort.
		2. **Time Estimation:** Estimate the duration of each activity, considering resource availability and constraints.
		3. **Resource Estimation:** Identify the type and quantity of resources needed for each activity.
	6. **Identify Activity Risks:** Helps to proactively manage potential issues that could impact project success.
		**Key Activities:**
		1. **Risk Identification:** Identify potential risks for each activity using techniques such as brainstorming and risk checklists.
		2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.
		3. **Risk Mitigation:** Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks, such as avoidance, reduction, transfer, or acceptance.
	7. **Allocate Resources:** Assign the necessary resources (human, technical, financial) to each activity to ensure successful execution.
		**Key Activities:**
		1. **Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources to activities, ensuring optimal use of available resources.
		2. **Resource Leveling:** Adjust resource assignments to avoid overallocation and ensure balanced workload.
		3. **Resource Scheduling:** Develop a detailed resource schedule, considering dependencies and constraints.
	8. **Review/Publicize Plan:** Review the project plan for completeness and accuracy, and communicate it to stakeholders.

	9. **Execute plan:**  Implement the project plan, monitor progress, and manage changes.
		**Key Activities:**
		1. **Project Execution:** Carry out the project activities as per the plan.
		2. **Progress Monitoring:** Track progress against the project schedule, budget, and scope.
		3. **Change Management:** Manage changes to the project scope, schedule, or resources, ensuring alignment with project objectives.
	10. **Lower Levels of Planning:** Develop detailed plans for specific phases or components of the project as needed.
		**Key Activities:**
		1. **Phase Planning:** Create detailed plans for each project phase, including specific activities, resources, and timelines.
		2. **Component Planning:** Develop plans for specific components or work packages, ensuring alignment with the overall project plan.
		3. **Continuous Improvement:** Refine and adjust plans based on lessons learned and feedback from ongoing project activities.

#### <span style="color:blue;">6. Suppose a software development company has undertaken a project that is expected to cost £190,000 to execute and the expected inflow is £25,000 per quarter for the first year, £30,000 per quarter there after. What is payback period for the project?</span>
1. To calculate the payback period, we need to determine the time it takes for the project's cumulative cash inflows to equal the initial investment.
2. Cash Inflows Breakdown
	1. **First Year Inflow**:
	    - £25,000 per quarter for 4 quarters:
	    - Total for the first year = £25,000 * 4 = £100,000
	2. **Subsequent Years Inflow**:
	    - From the second year onward, the inflow increases to £30,000 per quarter:
	    - Total for each subsequent year = £30,000 * 4 = £120,000
3. Cumulative Cash Inflows Calculation
	- **End of Year 1**:
	    - Cumulative inflow = £100,000
	- **End of Year 2**:
	    - Cumulative inflow = £100,000 + £120,000 = £220,000
4. Payback Period Calculation
	- By the end of Year 1, the company has recovered £100,000, leaving:
    - Remaining amount to recover = £190,000 - £100,000 = £90,000
	- In Year 2, the quarterly inflow is £30,000:
    - It will take:
        - Number of quarters to recover £90,000 = £90,000 / £30,000 = 3 quarters
5. Total Payback Period
	- Total payback period = 1 year (Year 1) + 3 quarters (from Year 2)
	- Since there are 4 quarters in a year, the payback period can be expressed as:
	    - Payback period = 1 year + 0.75 years = **1.75 years** or **1 year and 3 quarters**.

#### <span style="color:blue;">7. What is project? Explain various characteristics that distinguish project from routine jobs.</span>
1. A **project** is a endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has a defined beginning and end, specific objectives, constraints (such as time, cost, and quality), and involves a set of activities that are coordinated to achieve the desired outcome.

	    - **Communication**: Ensure that all team members are aware of the objectives and understand their roles in achieving them.

#### <span style="color:blue;">9. Explain the various bidding techniques along with their implications and applicability</span>
1. Once an organization’s top management is convinced by the business case, the project charter is developed.
2. Have a formal bidding process to select a suitable vendor based on some costperformance criteria.
3. Different types o f bidding techniques and their implications and applicability
	1. **Request for quotation (RFQ):** An organization advertises an RFQ if it has good understanding of the project and the possible solutions. While publishing the RFQ, the organization would have to mention the scope of the work in a statement of work (SOW) document.
	2. **Request for proposal (RFP):** The organization may solicit solution proposals from vendors. The vendors may submit a few alternative solutions and the approximate costs for each solution. In order to develop a better understanding, the requesting organization may ask the vendors to explain or demonstrate their solutions.
	3. **Request for Information (RFI):** An organization soliciting bids may publish an RFI. Based on the vendor response to the RFI, the organization can assess the competencies o f the vendors and shortlist the vendors who can bid for the work.

#### <span style="color:blue;">10. What is project? What are it's characteristics? Give importance of Software project management.</span>
1. A **project** is a endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has a defined beginning and end, specific objectives, constraints (such as time, cost, and quality), and involves a set of activities that are coordinated to achieve the desired outcome.
2. Characteristics of a project:
	1. **Non Routine:** In a project, non routine tasks are involed, meaning these are temporary tasks specific to the project.
	2. **Planning:** For a project proper planning is required to achieve the objectives of the project, without proper planning project will fail to deliver the product.
	3. **Unique Deliverables:** Specific objectives are to be met or specific product is to be created as an outcome of the project.
	4. **Timespan:** Project has a predefined time span (which can be absolute or relative). It helps to define the timelines under which the project should be started and finished.
	5. **Service:** Project is done as a service, meaning the work carried out for someone other than yourself.
	6. **Specialization:** In a project, the tasks are to be done by team members who are specialist of their own field.
	7. **Phased:** A project is phased which means work is carried out in different phases.
	8. **Resource Constraints:** Projects operate within limitations, including time, budget, and available resources, which necessitate careful planning and management.
3. **Importance of Software Project Management:**

	7. **Performance Measurement:** It establishes metrics for evaluating progress and performance, enabling continuous improvement and accountability.
#### <span style="color:blue;">11. How do you perform cost benefit analysis (CBA)?</span>
1. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach for evaluating the financial implications of a project or decision by comparing the expected costs against the anticipated benefits.
2. Even where the estimated benefits exceeds the estimated costs, it is often necessary to decide if the proposed project is the best of several options.
3. Cost Benefit Analysis comprises below steps:
	1. Identifying all of the costs and benefits of carrying out the project and operating the delivered application. These includes the development costs, operational costs and benefits expected from the new system.
	2. Expressing the costs and benefits in common units, we must express each cost and benefit and the net benefit which is the difference between the two - in money.
	3. We should repeat the above steps with other possible alternatives for our project.
	4. At last we could compare all those values and choose the best possible option for our project.

#### <span style="color:blue;">12. Consider the project cash flow estimates for four projects as shown in below table. Negative levels indicate expenditure and positive values represents income. Rank the four project in order of financial desirability and make a note of your reasons for ranking them in that way. Conclusion should be based on Net profit and ROI.</span>

2. Here are key steps involved:
1. **Resource Identification**:
    - Assess the types of resources needed, including human resources (skills and expertise), financial resources, equipment, and technology.
2. **Resource Planning**:
    - Develop a resource management plan that outlines how resources will be allocated across the program. This includes identifying resource availability, estimating resource requirements for each project, and scheduling their use.
3. **Prioritization**:
    - Evaluate and prioritize projects based on strategic importance, urgency, and resource availability. High-priority projects may receive resources first to ensure alignment with organizational goals.
4. **Allocation**:
    - Assign resources to projects based on the resource plan. This involves distributing human resources, budget, and equipment according to project needs and timelines.
5. **Monitoring and Adjusting**:
    - Continuously monitor resource utilization across projects to ensure they are being used effectively. Use tools like dashboards and reports to track allocation and performance.
6. **Communication and Collaboration**:
    - Foster open communication among project managers and stakeholders to address any resource conflicts or shortages promptly. Collaboration helps in reallocating resources as needed.
7. **Risk Management**:
    - Identify potential risks related to resource allocation, such as shortages or conflicts, and develop contingency plans to mitigate these risks.
8. **Feedback and Improvement**:
    - Gather feedback on resource allocation effectiveness and adjust strategies as necessary for future projects or programs. This iterative process helps refine resource management practices.

#### <span style="color:blue;">15. What is project charter in software project management? What are the elements of project charter?</span>
1. A project charter is a foundational document in software project management that formally authorizes a project, outlines its objectives, and provides a high-level overview of the project’s scope and stakeholders.
2. It serves as a reference point throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring alignment among stakeholders and guiding decision-making.
3. Importance of the Project Charter
	The project charter is essential for:
	- Providing a clear direction and focus for the project.
	- Ensuring stakeholder alignment and buy-in from the outset.
	- Serving as a reference point for project scope and objectives throughout the lifecycle.
	- Facilitating communication and decision-making among stakeholders.
4. Key Elements of a Project Charter
	1. **Project Title**:
	    - A clear and concise name for the project.
	2. **Project Purpose and Justification**:
	    - A statement outlining why the project is being undertaken and the problem it aims to solve or the opportunity it seeks to exploit.
	3. **Objectives and Goals**:
	    - Specific, measurable objectives that the project intends to achieve, often framed using the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
	4. **Scope Statement**:
	    - A high-level description of what is included in the project (deliverables and boundaries) and what is excluded.
	5. **Stakeholders**:
	    - Identification of key stakeholders, including project sponsors, team members, and any other parties affected by or involved in the project, along with their roles and responsibilities.
	6. **High-Level Requirements**:
	    - A summary of the major requirements and features that the project must fulfill, providing a basis for further detailed planning.
	7. **Assumptions and Constraints**:
	    - Key assumptions made during project planning and any constraints (such as time, budget, or resources) that may impact project execution.
	8. **Milestones**:
	    - Significant events or phases in the project timeline, often tied to deliverables or key approvals.
	9. **Budget Overview**:
	    - A high-level estimate of the project's budget, indicating overall costs and resource allocation.
	10. **Risks**:
	    - An initial identification of potential risks that may affect the project, along with strategies for risk management.
	11. **Approval and Authorization**:
	    - Signatures or endorsements from key stakeholders, formally authorizing the project and granting necessary resources.

#### <span style="color:blue;">16. Define the following terms: i)Net profit ii)Return on Investment iii)Payback period iv)Net present value v)Internal rate of return</span>
1. **Net Profit:** The net profit of a project is the difference between the total costs and the total income over the life of the project.
2. **Return on Investment:** The return on investment (ROI), also known as the accounting rate of return, provides a way to compare net profitability to the investment required. The straight forward version of the formula is:
	`ROI = (average annual profit)/total investment * 100`
3. **Payback Period:** The payback period is the time taken to break even or pay back the initial investment. Normally the project with the shortest payback period will be chosen on basis that an organization will wish to minimize the time that a project in 'in debt'.
4. **Net Present Value:** The calculation of net present value is a project evaluation technique that takes into account the profitability of the project and the timing of the cash flows that are produced. Formula is straigth forward:
	`Present Value = (value in year t)/((1 + r)^t)`
	Here **r** is the discount rate expressed as decimal value and **t** is the number of years into the future that cash flow occurs.
5. **Internal Rate of Return:** The IRR represents the discount rate at which the NPV of an investment's cash flow is zero. It is discounted cash flow technique which takes into account the time value of money.
